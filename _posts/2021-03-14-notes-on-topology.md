### Notes
pre-requisite: real-analysis

(1) Some random notes:
- real analyis is a sufficient background to get started, and topology is a natural next step 
- without at least an intermediate knowledge in set theory, it can be hard to delve into more interesting stuff in point-set Topology
- "irreducible core" of the subject: topological spaces, connectedness, compactness, and the countability and separation axioms 
- what is the point of generalization? 
- Course outline Part 1:
    - set theory and logic, 
    - topological spaces and continouos function, 
    - connectedness and compactness, 
    - countability
    - separation axioms  


(2) Topology without tears 
- topological notions like compactness, connectedness and denseess are as basic to mathematician of today as sets and functions were to those of last century. 
- branches of topology: 
    - general topology (point-set topology)
    - algebraic topology 
    - differential topology
    - topological algebra
- Point-set topology is the door to the study of others 
- in mathematics "or" is not exclusive, a or b (a and b being true at the same time)
- only by working through a good number of exercises will you master this course 

    **Chapter 1 - topological spaces**

    - we begin with the rules of topology 
    - definitions
        - finite topological spaces
        - discrete spaces: given a non-empty set X, if T is a collection of all the subsets of X, then T is said to be the discrete topology. (X,T) is called the topological space 
            - there is an infinite number of discrete spaces one for each set X
        - indiscrete spaces: given a non-empty set X, if T={X,0} (0 is null set) then T is called the indiscrete topology and (X,T) is said to be an indiscrete space  
        - spaces with the finite-closed topology 
    - topology is an axiomatic subject: each theorem or proposition represents a new level of knowledge and must be firmly anchored to the previous level, we attache the new level to the previous one using a proof 
    - what is a mathematical proof: a sequence of arguments, begins with information you are given, proceeds by logical argument and ends with what you are asked to prove 
    - begin a proof by writing down the information you are given
    - state what you asked to prove
    - if technical terms are given, define them
