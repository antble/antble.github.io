# Chapter 1: Monte Carlo Methods 
- we set out to study a host of classical and quantum problems, all of value as models and with numerous applications and generalizations 
- we also discuss the basic principles of statistical data analysis: how to extract results from well-behaved simulations 
- Monte carlos is extremely general, and the basic recipes allow us - in principle - to solve any problem in statistical physics
- in practice, much effort has to be spent in designing algorithms specifically geared to the problem at hand 
- concept of sampling 
    - 2 fundamentally different sampling approaches: direct sampling and 
    - markov-chain sampling: requires Metropolis algorithm 
- Monte Carlo method is a powerful approach for the calculation of integrals
