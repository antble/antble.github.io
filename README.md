I have a limited memory and an unorganized habit of doing projects and studies. To remedy this short-coming I started a github blog. This blog serves as a guide to where I'm heading and what I should be doing. In addition, the blog serves as a historical record of all the things that I've done because there are days I am sad, I need to remind myself what I have achieved so far. (I got the idea from Monterola). ðŸ˜‚
