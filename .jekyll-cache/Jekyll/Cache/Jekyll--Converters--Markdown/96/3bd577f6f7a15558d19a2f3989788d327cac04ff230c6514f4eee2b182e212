I"+<p>I’m currently exploring the Kwant python package because my thesis is inline with quantum transport. Kwant is a python package for numerical quantum transport calculations. The thing I like about Kwant, aside from being in python, is that it has been designed such that natural concepts of the theory of quantum theory are exposed in a simple and transparent way. Kwant offers direct support for calculations of transport properties, dispersion relations, modes, wave functions, variours Green’s functions, and out-of-equilibrium local quantities.</p>

<p><strong>Scattering</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>solving scattering problem is a common taks in condensed matter physics
    <ul>
      <li>one considers the scattering of particles in a finite system coupled to infinite <strong>leads</strong></li>
      <li>solutions yields the conductance and various other transport properties</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>can also be used to calculate complicated physical phenomena.
    <ul>
      <li>supercurrent</li>
      <li>non-equilibrium density of states at a high voltage bias</li>
      <li>evaluation of the topological properties of a topological insulator</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Numerical simulation of the scattering problem</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>most popular is the <strong>recursive Green’s function algorithm</strong> (RGF)</li>
  <li><strong>Kwant</strong> is develop to solve efficiently at comparatively little effort the scattering problem for arbitrary single-particle tight-binding Hamiltonians.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Kwant</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>solve the scattering problem in a robust and highly efficient way</li>
  <li>support an easy and expressive way to define a broad range of tight-binding systems as required for exploratory research.</li>
  <li>uses highly efficient and robust algorithms resulting to:
    <ul>
      <li>it outperform the RGF</li>
      <li>it avoid usual instabilities occurring with many commonly used algorithms</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Expressiveness of kwant is important for mesoscopic physics
    <ul>
      <li>one writes down a Hamiltonian that is very close to what one would write on a blackboard</li>
      <li>Definition of a physical system amount to writing a simple Python program that operates with physical concepts such as lattices, shapes, symmetries, and potentials.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Examples of a device that was simulated</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>cylindrical semiconductor wire with <em>spin-orbit interaction</em>, partially covered by a superconductor, used to create Majorana fermions.</li>
</ul>

<p>(kwant is suited for both infinite and finite systems with finite scattering region to which a few semi-finite periodic electrodes are connected.)</p>

<p>The Hamiltonian for systems in Kwant are defined as:
\(\hat{H}=\sum_{ij} H_{ij}c^\dagger_{i}c_{j}\)</p>

<p>where \(c^\dagger_{i}c_{j}\) are the usual fermionic creation(and destruction) operatos, i and j label the different degrees of freedom of the system, and \(H_{ij}\) are the elements of an infinite Hermitian matrix</p>
