<p>pre-requisite
(1) Some random notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>real analyis is a sufficient background to get started, and topology is a natural next step</li>
  <li>without at least an intermediate knowledge in set theory, it can be hard to delve into more interesting stuff in point-set Topology</li>
  <li>“irreducible core” of the subject: topological spaces, connectedness, compactness, and the countability and separation axioms</li>
  <li>what is the point of generalization?</li>
  <li>Course outline Part 1:
    <ul>
      <li>set theory and logic,</li>
      <li>topological spaces and continouos function,</li>
      <li>connectedness and compactness,</li>
      <li>countability</li>
      <li>separation axioms</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>(2) Topology without tears</p>
<ul>
  <li>topological notions like compactness, connectedness and denseess are as basic to mathematician of today as sets and functions were to those of last century.</li>
  <li>branches of topology:
    <ul>
      <li>general topology (point-set topology)</li>
      <li>algebraic topology</li>
      <li>differential topology</li>
      <li>topological algebra</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Point-set topology is the door to the study of others</li>
  <li>in mathematics “or” is not exclusive, a or b (a and b being true at the same time)</li>
  <li>
    <p>only by working through a good number of exercises will you master this course</p>

    <p><strong>Chapter 1 - topological spaces</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>we begin with the rules of topology</li>
      <li>definitions
        <ul>
          <li>finite topological spaces</li>
          <li>discrete spaces: given a non-empty set X, if T is a collection of all the subsets of X, then T is said to be the discrete topology. (X,T) is called the topological space
            <ul>
              <li>there is an infinite number of discrete spaces one for each set X</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>indiscrete spaces: given a non-empty set X, if T={X,0} (0 is null set) then T is called the indiscrete topology and (X,T) is said to be an indiscrete space</li>
          <li>spaces with the finite-closed topology</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>topology is an axiomatic subject: each theorem or proposition represents a new level of knowledge and must be firmly anchored to the previous level, we attache the new level to the previous one using a proof</li>
      <li>what is a mathematical proof: a sequence of arguments, begins with information you are given, proceeds by logical argument and ends with what you are asked to prove</li>
      <li>begin a proof by writing down the information you are given</li>
      <li>state what you asked to prove</li>
      <li>if technical terms are given, define them</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
