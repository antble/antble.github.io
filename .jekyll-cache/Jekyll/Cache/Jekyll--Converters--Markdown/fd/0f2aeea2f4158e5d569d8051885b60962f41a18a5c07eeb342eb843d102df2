<h3 id="what-is-solid-state-physics">What is Solid State Physics?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>study of solids armed with quantum theory</li>
  <li>focused largely on (quasi)particles living inside solids
    <ul>
      <li>electron (or holes), phonons, photons</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>part of condensed matter physics (this includes quantum fluids, soft biological matter, liquid crystals)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="why-is-solid-state-physics-so-important">Why is Solid State Physics so important?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>fractional charges</li>
  <li>attracting electrons</li>
  <li>magnetic monopoles</li>
  <li>flow without friction or resistance <em>(superconductivity or superfluidity)</em></li>
  <li>separation of spin and charge</li>
  <li>particles that are neither fermions nor bosons (anyons, non-abelian anyons)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-we-are-going-to-learn">What we are going to learn</h3>
<ul>
  <li>why metals conduct</li>
  <li>why some things are transparent and others not</li>
  <li>why computers compute</li>
  <li>why magnets stick to fridge doors</li>
  <li>why energy bands bend at the Brillouin zone boundaries</li>
</ul>

<p>The crystal structures are very important to know the properties of the solid. 
We can make an experiment that will reveal the crystal structure of our solid - x-ray diffraction.</p>
