<ul>
  <li>we set out to study a host of classical and quantum problems, all of value as models and with numerous applications and generalizations</li>
  <li>we also discuss the basic principles of statistical data analysis: how to extract results from well-behaved simulations</li>
  <li>Monte carlos is extremely general, and the basic recipes allow us - in principle - to solve any problem in statistical physics</li>
  <li>in practice, much effort has to be spent in designing algorithms specifically geared to the problem at hand</li>
  <li>concept of sampling
    <ul>
      <li>2 fundamentally different sampling approaches: direct sampling and</li>
      <li>markov-chain sampling: requires Metropolis algorithm</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Monte Carlo method is a powerful approach for the calculation of integrals</li>
